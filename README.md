# SwaggerAPI

‚öô What is the technical challenge? We're looking for professionals who are very familiar with the stack we're using. As this is a Backend engineer test, you are tasked with implementing an OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) compliant web service that abstracts away two downstream APIs; the Chuck Norris API and the Star Wars API. Your API should do the following:
ÓÅ≤ÓÇî You should develop an OpenAPI compliant API ÓÅ≥ÓÇî Your API should have 3 root paths: ÓÅ≤ÓÇî /chuck ÓÅ≥ÓÇî /swapi ÓÅ¥ÓÇî /search ÓÅ¥ÓÇî It should have an endpoint at /chuck/categories which returns the result of https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/categories (all the joke categories) ÓÅµÓÇî It should have an endpoint at /swapi/people which returns the result of https://swapi.dev/api/people/ (all the Star Wars people) ÓÅ∂ÓÇî Finally, the /search endpoint should call both the https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/search?query={query} and the https://swapi.dev/api/people/?search={query} when queried in order to simultaneously search both the Chuck Norris and Star Wars API. The response should also contain metadata which indicates which API the result belongs to. ÓÅ∑ÓÇî The /search endpoint should accept query data as a query string
